 Allows to transform layer created with radish with different position/rotation in the same or different hubs.
 
 How to use:
 - Execute the script, it will ask for two files and one directory.
 - First file is your .yml layer to copy.
 - Second file is your new reference layer with just one entity named exactly as the corresponding entity in your layer to copy. This new entity is the new reference.
 - The directory asked is the destination directory where you will find a layer.transformed.yml
